# Test task for supervisor before the final project (HSE, 2021)

The aim of the task was developing LR and XGB models for two datasets:
* [The breast cancer dataset] (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html)
* [The digits dataset] (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits)

Requirements to the models:
a. Robust classifier we are able to trust to (e.g. using cross-validation)
b. Unstable classier (e.g. underfitted or overfitted)
